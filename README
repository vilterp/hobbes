HOBBES

Hobbes is an interpreted dynamic language. Everything's an object like Ruby and Smalltalk, but minimalist and sensible like Python.

This is my first language, so I'm implementing it in Python cuz it's easy. Maybe once I figure out what I'm doing I'll port it to java so it's reasonably fast, maybe not.
