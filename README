HOBBES

Hobbes is an interpreted dynamic language. Philosophy: minimalist and sensible like Python, but everything's an object like Ruby and Smalltalk.

This is my first language, so I'm implementing it in Python cuz that's easiest for me. Maybe once I figure out what I'm doing I'll port it to java so it's reasonably fast, maybe I won't. We'll see where it goes.
